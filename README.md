Welcome to TMT caTissue!
=====================================

An important aspect of caTissue is the body of test scripts and the results of running those scripts on various builds. This provides a means of testing caTissue to those who wish to check the impact of modifications they make to the applications. The scripts and other data are held in a MySQL database. TMT-caTissue project supplements the Test Management Tool (TMT) with data transformations and report generation to help review the status of testing.
